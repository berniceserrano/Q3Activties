				<h6>Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired<br> on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. This is a show about love and careers and a time <br>in life when everything is possible ... about the search for commitment and security ... and the fear of commitment<br> and security. Most of all, it's about friendship--for when you're young and single in the city, your friends are your family.</h6>
